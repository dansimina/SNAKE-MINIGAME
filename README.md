# 🐍 Snake Game in Java

This repository contains a simple **Snake Game** implemented in **Java** using **Swing** for the graphical user interface (GUI). The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

## 📌 Features

- 🎮 **Classic Snake Game Mechanics** – Control the snake using arrow keys.
- 🍏 **Food Generation** – The snake grows when it eats food.
- 🚀 **Game Over Condition** – Collision with itself ends the game.
- 🎨 **Graphical Grid Display** – The board is displayed with a grid using Swing.
- 🔄 **Auto-Wrapping** – The snake wraps around the edges of the board instead of crashing.
- 🛠 **MVC Design Pattern** – Ensures clean separation between logic, UI, and control.


## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Run the game** by executing `Main.java`.
2. **Control the snake** using the arrow keys:
   - ⬆️ **Up**
   - ⬇️ **Down**
   - ⬅️ **Left**
   - ➡️ **Right**
3. **Objective**: Eat food to grow longer and avoid colliding with yourself.
